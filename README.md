# Knowledge Hub (Working Title)

## Overview

**Knowledge Hub** is a platform designed to support learning, repetition, personal development, and meaningful interaction among users. The aim is to create a knowledge-centric environment where people can grow intellectually and connect with others based on shared learning goals.

## Vision

The platform is built around several core ideas:

1. **Knowledge Base**  
   A structured repository of materials useful for students, university attendees, course participants, and lifelong learners.

2. **Smart Repetition**  
   Tools to help users effectively review and retain knowledge over time, based on proven repetition and memory techniques.

3. **Productivity & Motivation**  
   Integrated tools such as to-do lists, reminders, and progress tracking to improve discipline, motivation, and time management.

4. **Community & Interaction**  
   A thematic discussion space where users can engage in topic-based conversations, ask questions, and exchange ideas.

5. **Mentorship Exchange**  
   A mentorship system where users can find mentors or offer their expertise to others. This is built on a barter-like concept: "Mentor in one area, learn in another."

## Core Purpose

The main goal is to enable continuous self-development through structured learning, social accountability, and community-driven knowledge exchange.
